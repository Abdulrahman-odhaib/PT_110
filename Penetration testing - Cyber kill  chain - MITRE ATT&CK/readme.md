# Cyber Kill Chain and Penetration Testing Integration

### MITRE ATT&CK: is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat actors and security professionals to emulate cyber attacks and improve defenses.
### Cyber Kill Chain framework: developed by Lockheed Martin, is a method for identifying and preventing cyber intrusions. It describes the stages of a cyber attack from early reconnaissance to the final data exfiltration. 

## Integrating both the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK with the phases of penetration testing provides a holistic approach to understanding, testing, and improving security defenses. Hereâ€™s how you can align all three:

## 1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Reconnaissance
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Reconnaissance, Resource Development
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Planning and Reconnaissance
- **Key Activities:** Gathering data on target, identifying valuable assets and potential attack vectors.

## 2. Scanning (Scanning and Enumeration)
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Weaponization & Delivery
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Discovery
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Scanning and Enumeration
- **Key Activities:** Identifying live hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

## 3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Exploitation
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Initial Access
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Gaining Access
- **Key Activities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks.

## 4. Maintaining Access
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Installation
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Persistence
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Maintaining Access
- **Key Activities:** Installing backdoors or other malicious tools to ensure persistent access.

## 5. Privilege Escalation
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Command and Control (C2)
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Privilege Escalation
- **Key Activities:** Gaining higher level privileges, evading security measures.

## 6. Exploration (Lateral Movement)
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Command and Control (C2)
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Lateral Movement
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Exploration and Lateral Movement
- **Key Activities:** Moving through the network to access additional systems, spreading laterally.

## 7. Reporting (Analysis and Reporting)
- **Cyber Kill Chain Stage:** Actions on Objectives
- **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:** Exfiltration, Impact
- **Penetration Testing Phase:** Reporting
- **Key Activities:** Gathering and exfiltrating data, reporting findings, potential impacts, and recommendations.

### Integration Benefits:

- **Comprehensive View:** This alignment offers a comprehensive view of an attack from planning to execution, providing a detailed framework for penetration testers.
- **Enhanced Simulation:** Simulating attacks following these models helps testers think like attackers and identify weak points in the security posture more effectively.
- **Improved Defense:** Organizations can use this integrated approach to better prepare and defend against sophisticated cyber threats by understanding typical adversary behaviors and improving detection and response strategies.
